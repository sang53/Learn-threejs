## **Spheres 3D**

This is a 3D background developed for my portfolio page. It many spheres that move towards the pointer, rotate and change colour.

**Features:**

- Spheres actually move towards the real world coordinates of the pointer at z depth -50
- Spheres are relocated to random coordinates when they hit the z minimum border (currently -100)
- Spheres change colour closer to the z minimum border
- A spotlight follows the pointer
- Spheres change colour faster on hover
- Spheres are relocated to random coordinates when the pointer leaves the sphere

**Technologies:**

- Three js
- React 3 Fiber
- React
- TypeScript
